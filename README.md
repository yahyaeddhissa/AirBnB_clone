# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console Collaborative Project

This repository contains code of the first step towards building an AirBnB clone. It's a command interpreter which allows us to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
